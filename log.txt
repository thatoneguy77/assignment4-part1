Tasks: During this time I created the multtable file and toyed around with the lecture code to get a feel for things.  I am at the point where I need to check to see if the values are ints.

Tasks: During this time I created a table that displayed the correct results.  It took some tinkering to get it how I wanted and I'm positive there are better ways to do it.  The multtable file is now completed.  Also a note on the amount of time it is taking me to complete these tasks.  I take my dog about around once an hour for ten minutes at a time.  I have not been creating seperate worklogs to show these ten minutes breaks plus however long it takes me to get going again.

Tasks: During this time I completed the login, content1, and content2 files.  For me the most time consuming part was figuring out how to redirect to the login in page if they tried to get to the content pages without ever going through the login page.
